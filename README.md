Creating a `README.md` file for a Terraform project is essential for documenting the setup, usage, and commands necessary for managing infrastructure. Below is a template that you can use for your Terraform project, focusing on the `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` commands.

```markdown
# Terraform Project README

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing infrastructure resources. Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version X.X.X)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom)
- Access to your cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and manage your Terraform infrastructure.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-terraform-repo.git
cd your-terraform-repo
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform

The `terraform init` command initializes the working directory containing the Terraform configuration files. It downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend for state management.

```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Review the Execution Plan

Before applying any changes, itâ€™s a good practice to review the execution plan using the `terraform plan` command. This command shows you what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state defined in your configuration files.

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 4. Apply the Changes

Once you are satisfied with the execution plan, you can apply the changes to your infrastructure using the `terraform apply` command. This command will prompt for confirmation before proceeding.

```bash
terraform apply
```

To skip the confirmation prompt, you can use the `-auto-approve` flag:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Important Commands

- **`terraform init`**: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- **`terraform plan`**: Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take.
- **`terraform apply`**: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state.

## Cleaning Up

To destroy the resources created by Terraform, use the `terraform destroy` command. This command will also prompt for confirmation.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

To skip the confirmation prompt, use:

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### Notes:
- Replace `yourusername` and `your-terraform-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
- Adjust the Terraform version in the prerequisites section as necessary.
- You can expand the "Additional Resources" section with links to any specific documentation or tutorials relevant to your project. 

This template provides a clear and structured way to document your Terraform project, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand how to use it effectively.
